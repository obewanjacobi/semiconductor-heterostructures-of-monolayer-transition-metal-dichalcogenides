Transition metal dichalcogenides are a growing interest in the community of condensed matter physics. These substances show promise in the areas of small electronics, optoelectronic devices, and low powered devices. Our group observed the properties of single layered (2 dimensional) semiconductor heterostructures. To make our materials, we cleaned substrates, place them in a thermal evaporator to put on the transition metals, and then put on the chalcogen layer through chemical vapor deposition using a three zone furnace (chalcogenization). We made the heterostructure films in three different ways, known as Series A, B, and C. In Series A, we put both transition metals on the substrate through thermal evaporation, and then put the samples through chalcogenization. In Series B, we put one metal on the substrate and put it through chalcogenization, then repeated the process with another transition metal. For Series C we made two separate films, then put them through a film transfer to stack the films and make heterostructures. Our methods of observing the materials include Raman spectroscopy, UV visible optical spectroscopy, TEM, and AFM. Our results approximately lined up with the previously published theoretical. This shows promise for making the materials using the methods we used. We hope to make a device using our films to show their potential uses.
